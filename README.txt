The Rubiks cube Demo.

In this application you will be able to rotate and turn different sides of the rubiks cube.
Each of the cubes faces are printed out and displayed in a console application.
To run this console application you will need to navigate to RubiksCubeDemo and run the RubiksCubeConsole.exe file.

In the application you need to use keys to and specific commands to interact with the cube.
The intial questions are basic requesting you simply answer yes or no which you can supply with the 'y' key or the 'n' key on your keyboard.

There is a section that allows you to input your own instructions, you specify the command and hit enter. The commands for these are below:

'f' -> Front face Clockwise rotation
'fi' -> Front face Counter-Clockwise rotation
'r' -> Right face Clockwise rotation
'ri' -> Right face Counter-Clockwise rotation
'u' -> Up face Clockwise rotation
'ui' -> Up face Counter-Clockwise rotation
'b' -> Back face Clockwise rotation
'bi' -> Back face Counter-Clockwise rotation
'l' -> Left face Clockwise rotation
'li' -> Left face Counter-Clockwise rotation
'd' -> Down face Clockwise rotation
'di' -> Down face Counter-Clockwise rotation
's' -> Check if the rubiks cube is solved

To get out of the custom inputs section use the 'c' key and from the intial question use the escape key to exit out of it.
